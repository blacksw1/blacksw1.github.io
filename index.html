  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h3>Credentials</h3>
  <p>My name is [redacted]. I have an MSci in Physics, 6 years of experience in exchange traded commodity swaps trading and now work as a Strategy Analyst. I have experience with Excel, Python, and, more recently, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript, with SQL being the strongest of the latter 4. I am undertaking Codecademy's Full Stack Developer course as I'd like to be able to build websites and webapps from front to back independently.</p>

  <h3>Interests</h3>
  <h4>Financial Markets</h4>
  <p>I have been interested in the financial markets for some time now. What started out as an interest in the more technical aspects (essentially in the hope of significant monetary gain) has become the foundation of my newfound interest on the effects of financial markets on ordinary working people. I'm passionate about the subject of financial knowledge (or lack thereof, in the general population) and would like, someday, to teach people what I have learnt and make it accessible to ordinary people or people for whom the intricacies of finance, trading and investing or the impacts of the decisions of 'their' cental bank do not constitute one of their passions. I truly believe that knowledge of the financial markets would benefit all, since all are impacted by them, often without knowledge. It is for this reason that one of my ongoing projects is to build a website to explain in simple terms what is going on in the economy, by ridding the broadsheet explanations of jargon and visualising the data in a way that the conclusion can not be influenced by one's personal bias.</p>

  <h4>Weightlifting</h4>
  <p>"What disgrace it is for a man to grow old without ever seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable" - Socrates</p>
  <p>I have been passionate about weightlifting since probably the age of 15 - the age at which I shed my much prolonged 'puppy fat' and started becoming a man. It gave me greater confidence, self-esteem and belief in myself. It firmly reinforced an idea that, around this time, had just been sprouting inside me - that many outstanding and incredible things are possible with consistent hard work and sacrifice of the today for the tomorrow. It taught me to trust the process. Let this idea take over your mind like a parasite.</p>

  <h4>Stoicism & Religion</h4>
  <p>One hopes that this page doesn't read like a how-to manual for the 'Type-A Personality in the Western World', though I realise this hope is futile. I stumbled upon stoicism many years ago. As a white western male, I have gone through what I believe is rather a common path in terms of my philosophy on religion. In simple terms, my spiritual or religious journey looks something like the following. When I was young, I thought that Christianity was at best outdated and, at worst, a grotesque and ill-advised, nay, downright stupid, application of millenia-old rules and regulations to a modern world that simply did not fit. Of course I read 'The God Delusion' by Richard Dawkins around this time and thought it the most powerful piece of writing of our generation, a literary marvel. I grew up in the era of suicide bombings, and soon Islam became the vessel for my newfound atheism, harboring my distaste for all tales (very) old and unwise. Some time later, while I was at Uni, I found Jordan Peterson, and his lectures on religious and otherwise iconography. Here is where I started to find my home, not far from where I currently reside in terms of my philosophy on religion. My thoughts then and now are that to dismiss the best selling book in the world, without having read and understood it, in my own way, in full is folly. The true value, in my humble opinion, of the Bible is the truly timeless tales that it contains. It tells stories immemorial, stories only a paragraph long that contain fundamental truths about the human condition. The Bible is as Lindy as they come - because it conveys universal truths. Regarding my belief in a God, my personal subscription is that God is that little voice in the back of your head askiing you if you really should eat that extra Smokehouse BBQ Pork Rib, if you really should go for a beer tonight, if you should own up and apologise for your wrongdoing. Reading the Bible in the context of this personal adaptation to the meaning of God unveils so much more value from the book. Value that I had precluded myself from experiencing all those years ago. There is, of course, a lot to be said of the social implications of a movement away from (as we have seen over the last 30 years) or toward Judaeo-Christian values, but that is for another forum. Suffice to say, this journey has been a long one, with winds and turns, but a common thread through all of this is Stoicism. At times, it has felt like a replacement for spirituality and religion, and I think that it could be. There have been plenty of times where I have felt superiority over the religious by virtue of the fact that 'I am a stoic'. This misses the whole point of Stoicism. Stoicism is a method, a philosophy, a process (much like Christianity) and one I think empowers people to grab the proverbial bull of life by the horns. To conclude, I don't consider myself religious but, now, more than ever before, I consider the value of religion, the Bible in particular, in our society and I think we could do with a little more Christian virtue. I am becoming more spiritual and, in contrast to many moons ago, don't consider that to be at odds with the Stoic philosophy, but an augmentation to and even an integral aspect of it.</p>
